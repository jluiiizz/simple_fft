# Simple FFT Algorithm

This is a simple implementation of the [Cooley-Tukey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooley%E2%80%93Tukey_FFT_algorithm) FFT algorithm.

It was done with the purpose of learn ways to solve the DWT step of the [JPEG-2000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JPEG_2000) image compression algorithm.

Any kind of help in other, better or worse ways to solve this problem are welcome.
